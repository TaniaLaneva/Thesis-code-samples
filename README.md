# Thesis-code-samples
Code samples for bachelor thesis.

Dear contributors!

Iâ€™m kindly asking you to test files: Vector, TriangleValidator, TrianglePerimeterCalculator, Point3D and Perimeter Class.
Classes Perimeter and TrianglePerimeterCalculator calculate the perimeter of any triangle in 3-dimensional space.

Some data might be useful for testing, to save your time :

1)	Example of collinear points: p(6,5,3), p(4,3,1) and p(2,1,-1)
2)	Example of parallel vectors: v(2,2,2) and v(4,4,4)

A bit more information about collinear points can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDt9M8_zxlw]
Please, commit your tests on your branch. I am appreciated for your contribution.

Best Regards,

Tania
